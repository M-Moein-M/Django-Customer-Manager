#### Credential file
Some credentials are loaded from a file called **cred.txt**.
Create a text file: /app/ContactManager/cred.txt
The content of the file should be filled like this but with your credentials and values:
```
{	
"RES_PASS_EMAIL":"A",
"RES_PASS_PASSWORD":"B",
"IBB_API_KEY":"C"
}
```
* A -> The email django uses to send a reset password link for customer when he/she requests a password reset
* B -> Password of the eamil you entered in A
* C -> API key that you can get from [imgbb](https://imgbb.com) to upload images
